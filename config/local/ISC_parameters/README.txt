IMPREFECT RF SPOILING (ISC) CORRECTION PARAMETERS 
(Preibisch and Deichmann, MRM 61:125-135 (2009))
Correction parameters formerly calculated by Antoine Lutti (15/01/09)
for a series of standard protocols can be selected manually. 
Effective TR and FA values (more precisely: [TR_pdw TR_t1w fa_pdw
fa_t1w]) are stored within each ISC file. 
Additional protocol types and correction factors can be computed online 
and directly chosen as dependency input file to apply proper RF correction.
The stored values for P2_a and P2_b were obtained using the code supplied 
by R. Deichmann with the experimental parameters used for the standard 
MPM protocol and assuming T2 = 64 ms at 3T.
When enabling the imperfect spoiling correction, make sure the
calculated coefficients are definitely calculated for the protocol used!
