The hMRI-toolbox is an easy-to-use open-source tool for data handling and processing of quantitative MRI data. This toolbox, embedded in the SPM framework, allows the estimation of quantitative MRI maps (longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates R1 and R2*, proton density PD, and magnetization transfer MT) ([Weiskopf et al., 2013](#Weiskopf.2013)), followed by spatial registration in common space for statistical analysis ([Draganski et al., 2011](#Draganski.2011)). It also offers flexibility for calculation of novel MRI biomarkers of tissue microstructure ([Mohammadi et al., 2015](#Mohammadi.2015)).\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\nThe hMRI-toolbox is free but copyright software, distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence as published by the Free Software Foundation (either version 2, as given in file LICENSE, or at your option, any later version). Further details on \"copyleft\" can be found [here](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/). In particular, the hMRI-toolbox is supplied as is. No formal support or maintenance is provided or implied.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nThe hMRI-toolbox Matlab code (beta release v0.1.2) can be downloaded [here](https://github.molgen.mpg.de/hMRI-group/Toolbox/releases/download/release-v0.1.2-beta/hMRI-Toolbox-v0.1.2-beta.zip).\r\n\r\n## Supporting Material\r\n### Wiki-Pages\r\n\r\nFor a collection of installation and usage instructions please visit our [Wiki pages](https://github.molgen.mpg.de/hMRI-group/Toolbox/wiki) (currently work in progress).\r\n\r\n### hMRI-Toolbox Paper & Poster\r\n\r\nFor a reference on the scientific background, methods and concepts please use the [pre-print paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.20347/WIAS.PREPRINT.2527) and cite that, when publishing results compiled with the hMRI-toolbox. \r\nA conference poster is also available [here](https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/225763).\r\n\r\n### hMRI Example Data and MRI Protocol\r\n\r\nA dataset for exploring the possibilities and functionality of the hMRI-toolbox can be found [here](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/iv2TOQwGy4FGDDZ). At the same place you also find a sample MRI protocol, as well as a setup (for Siemens 3T MRI) and usage tutorial. Please be aware that we provide these information without any warranty and that these protocols might not be optimal, since this reflects work in progress. \r\n\r\n### E-Mail List\r\n\r\nWe have created an e-mail list for users of the hMRI-toolbox.
